## Operating systems

Stipple Effect is available for Windows, macOS and Linux distros. However, the program is optimized for Windows.

## Java & Program Distributions

Stipple Effect is a Java program and requires the Java 17 Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed on your machine in order to run.

The *Windows installer* distribution of the program installs the JRE for you along with the program executable. Despite the larger file size, **the Windows installer distribution is the recommended distribution to install and run Stipple Effect on Windows**.

The *Cross-Platform Build* program distribution will require a separate one-time installation of the JRE. You can find the right version for your machine [on Oracle's website]().
