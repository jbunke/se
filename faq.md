## Updates and Issues

### **Q: How do I get updates?**

A: Stipple Effect is not updated automatically, so you will have to look out for updates and download them when they are released. The best way to do this is to follow the project or the developer somewhere:

* [Star Stipple Effect on GitHub](https://github.com/jbunke/stipple-effect)
* [Itch.io - Add Stipple Effect to a collection or follow the developer](https://flinkerflitzer.itch.io/stipple-effect)
* [Follow the developer on X](https://x.com/flinkerflitzer)

It is important to remember whether you bought Stipple Effect via Itch.io or Humble Bundle. When an update is released, **you will have to download the latest version on the same marketplace that you initially purchased the program**. If you cannot remember where you bought Stipple Effect, please contact the developer.
